# TODO (But not really)
Ok I know, this is not really a TODO, this is mostly filled with ideas and such. But this filename got a really nice icon in vs code.

## Change indentifier characters?
Consider indentifier names. What should the indentStart and indentLetter (in src/Lexer.hs) be? Names like + and * are cool (maybe haskell style infix operators...), but require parser rework.

## Pre-compile syntax style
Change parser to use more "haskell style" syntax, for example the imports statements now use ` #import <file_name> `, which is ugly but make parsing easier.
I want to minimize the amount of reserved keywords, so maybe a pre-compiler section in the program. This pre-compile stage might be in line with the planned typed dialect syntax.

```
{*

import file1
import file2

*}
```

And maybe some other {C / C} style for macro implementation and such. Where C is some character, like '-' for comments and '*' in the example above.

```
{+ macro_name
macro_body
+}
```

I'm not sure whether the macro body should be defined in Haskell (with code injection), or BruSKI.
