# BruSKI

![banner](images/BruSKI-banner.jpg?raw=true "Title")

### "DeBruijn to SKI" Untyped language that compiles to Unlambda.
Haskell project that aims to show that small abstractions to lambda calculus yield a surprisingly useful language.
And in some part for me to investigate my interest in the interface between lambda calculus and combinatory logic.

## Installation
Note that this is in alpha, so expect some bugs and missing features. Feel free to open an issue if you find a bug that is not listed!

First, make sure you have stack installed. You can find it here:

https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install

Then run the install script

```
$ ./install.sh
```

## bruc
Bruc (like the name Bruce) is the BruSKI compiler, it is copied to your bin during installation and you should be able to run it in the terminal.

```
$ bruc
      ~  ~          
    ( o )o)         
   ( o )o )o)       
 (o( ~~~~~~~o

## Specification

BruSKI uses variable abstraction and lambda notation that evaluates to Unlambda.

### Expressions

Expressions are written in de Bruijn indexed lambda calculus. A variable is represented as the number of binders that are in scope of its binder (starting from 0, which is non-standard).

| Standard           | De Bruijn     |
|--------------------|---------------|
| λf.λg.λx.f x (g x) | λλλ 2 0 (1 0) |
| λa.λb.a            | λλ 1          |
| λx.x               | λ 0           |

### Application

Functions are called by their name, with their arguments enclosed in curly brackets.

```
FUNC_NAME{VAR1, VAR2, ...}
```

Note that the number of variables are free to vary, as long as it is less than or equal to the arity of the function.
Not applying the full amount of arguments will result in partial application, and another function is returned.

It is perfectly fine to call functions by applying them to each other, in a Haskell-like syntax.

```
(FUNC_NAME VAR1 VAR2) => ((FUNC_NAME VAR1) VAR2)
```

This is semantically equivalent to the previous syntax, but less powerful. This is because the compiler does not check the arity of the function, nor can you format the application on multiple rows.

### The (:=) operator
Expressions can be assigned to identifiers using the _:=_ operator. This will place the expression in the symbol table after it is expanded.

```
zero := λλ0 :: 0
```

### The (::) operator
As you might have seen earlier in the file, (::) follow every assignment expresssion. It will assign a arity to the written expression. This is not necessary however, since the compiler will assign the correct arity to the function if (::) is left out. This can be used to restrict the use of encoded expressions by assigning a arity lower that the actual one.

Take the successor function in the church encoding. The expression has three binders (where the two latter ones are used for encoding) but we never want the function to accept more than one argument, the number to increment. Therefore we assign it the arity one, with the (::) operator.

```
succ := λλλ (1 (2 1 0)) :: 1
```

Assigning arities higher than the amount of binders is also possible, but rarely used. One example where this is useful is when η-reducing assignments.

```
+ := λλ add{1, 0} -- non η-reduced
+ := add :: 2     -- η-reduced
```

### The (!!) operator

Expressions written after the (!!) operator will be evaluated and compiled. Expressions written like this on multiple rows will be concatenated and evaluated as one.

```
true  := λλ1 :: 0
false := λλ0 :: 0
or    := λλ (1 true 0) 

!! or{true, false}

{-
This will evaluate to <k>
equivalent to the 'true' function
-}
```

### Built-ins

Some built-in "syntactic sugar" functions are included, for ease of use. These include functions for encoding types in lambda expressions and language conversions to Unlambda. All encodings act essentially like macros, expanding into pure BruSKI code in the compiler.

#### INT

_INT_ converts natural numbers to their church encoding.

```
INT{2} => succ{succ{λλ0}}
```

#### CHR

_CHR_ encodes a character like the Church encoding with its ASCII integer value being encoded.

```
CHR{d} => INT{100}
```

#### Lists

Because of the clunky syntax, lists can be encoded in the standard `[a, b, c]` way.

```
-- These are the same
list := cons{a, cons{b, cons{c, nil}}}
list := [a, b, c]
```

Tuples are defined similarly.

```
tuple := <a,b>
```

You can also map other encoding functions onto lists.

```
nums := [INT{1}, INT{2}, INT{3}] -- instead of this
nums := INT[1, 2, 3]             -- do this

unls := UNL[s,k,i,.X,v]
str  := "Looks Nice!" -- CHR gets special treatment
```

Note that, since these are macros and just expand to other code, you have to include the list library from prelude when using this syntax.

#### UNL

Expressions can be written in Unlambda using the _UNL_ function. This enables the programmer to use more powerful features (printing, call-with-current-continuation, input, etc.).

```
UNL{```.H.i.!i}
```

#### PRT

Instead of writing the _.x_ unlambda operator in the _UNL_ function, you can use _PRT_ with a string. This string will be converted to an Unlambda function printing it.

```
PRT{BruSKI} => UNL{``````.B.r.u.S.K.Ii}
```

### Comments

The characters _--_ (double dash) denote comments. Multiline comments use the symbol  _{- / -}_.

```
-- Ooga booga
kComb {- the K-combinator -} := λλ 1 :: 2
```

## Example

```
{! import bools !}

--!-- adder example

cin     := F
halfAdd := λλ (xor 0 1)
add     := λλ (xor cin halfAdd{0, 1}) 
cout    := λλ or { (and 0 1)
                 , (and cin halfAdd{0, 1})
                 }

chs := λ (0 UNL{.T} UNL{.F})
out := λ (chs{0} (λ0)) :: 1

!! out {
		add{ F , T } --> T, that is 1
   } 
```

Another, with syntax highlighting!

## Compiler Architecture
Simplified overview of the compiler.
![compover](images/compiler-overview.svg)

The ASTs used in the compiler are described below, in Backus-Naur form.
```
-- BruSKI statements
<Stmt> ::= Assign <String> <Bλ> <Integer> -- (:=)
         | Express <Bλ>			  -- (!!)
	 | Import <String>		  -- (import)

-- DeBruijn statements
<Bλ> ::= Idx <Integer>       -- DeBruijn indeces
       | Abs <Bλ>            -- Lambda abstractions
       | App <Bλ> <Bλ>       -- Application
       | Unl <String>        -- Unlambda injection
       | Fun <String> [<Bλ>] -- Functions

-- Intermediate representation
-- a mix of DeBruijn and SKI terms
<Iλ> ::= <Bλ> | S | K | I

--!-- Other structures

-- Entries in the symbol table
<Symbol> ::= (<String>, (<Bλ>, <Int>))

-- Lexed tokens

## Contributing
You are welcome to open issues if you find bugs, but I'm currently not accepting pull requests. Although this might be silly, I want to finish this project alone.
